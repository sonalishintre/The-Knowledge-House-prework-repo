# Make your computer shout you out!
#Programming a computer seems complicated but in reality, it is just learning the commands #your computer understands so you can make it do what you want it to do. The material does this #to is data, that can be numbers, strings (sets of characters enclosed in ""), or a boolean which represents true and false, 0 or 1. In order for your computer to show text on a screen you must tell it what you want it to say with a
#print statement
#Ex1: print "Hello World"
#Output would be: Hello World
#you can also capture strings and number and save them under names called variables: greeting = "Hello World" print greeting
#Output would be: Hello World
#Ex 2
#You can also take words user's input (or from other sources) and sub them into your string
#in the below example we have a variable that will save a users input for their favorite food: fav_food = input("What is your favorite food?") print "My favorite food is " + fav_food #OUTPUT: #"What is your favorite food?: Burgers"#My favorite food is Burgers

# EX1
print("Hello World")

greeting = "Hello World"
print(greeting)

# Ex2
fav_food = input("What is your favorite food?: ")
print("My favorite food is " + fav_food)

#output
#What is your favorite food?: Burgers
#My favorite food is Burgers

My_Name = input("What is your Name?: ")
print("My Name is " + My_Name)

#output:
#What is your Name?: Sonali
#My Name is Sonali
